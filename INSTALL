Dependencies:
 Client:
  protobuf (2.4.1 [default Ubuntu 12.04 distro])
  zeromq (4.0.3)
  boost (1.46.1 minimum)
 Server (in addition to client dependencies)
  mongodb c++ driver (branch 26compat)
 Database (to be installed on server system at this time)
  mongodb-2.6.0 (branch v2.6) [32-bit for local testing, 64-bit for deployment]

Installation:
 Database:
  1.
   Install mongo (branch v2.6) https://github.com/mongodb/mongo.git
   32-bit ok for testing.  64-bit for deployment as 32-bit has 2.4 GB limit
   refer to mongo/docs/building.md.
   To install mongo:
    ~> sudo scons core --prefix=/opt/mongo install
  2.
   Create a mongo user, e.g. mongodb, to limit access rights
   Create directory /data/db and give the mongo user ownership
   If --prefix was set to something outside the system path, e.g. /opt/mongo, 
    export that path to the system PATH variable in the mongo user bash script

 Server:
  1.
   Install mongo-cxx-driver (branch 26compat) https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver.git
    ~> sudo scons --full --use-system-boost --prefix=/usr/local --sharedclient --install-mongoclient
    - or -
    ~> sudo scons --32 --sharedclient --release --full --use-system-boost --cpppath=/usr/include install-mongoclient
   Note: I've used both methods to install, but you pretty much have to specify 
   everything in the first example at a minimum.
  2.
   Make and Install Reveal
    Currently, there is no cmake configuration to differentiate between client
    only, server only and full install.  To make and install, in the top level
    Reveal directory:
     ~> mkdir build
     ~> cd build
     ~> cmake ..
     ~> make
     ~> sudo make install
