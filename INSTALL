Dependencies:
 Client:
  protobuf (2.4.1 [default Ubuntu 12.04 distro])
  zeromq (4.0.3)
  boost (1.46.1 minimum)
  tinyxml
 Server (in addition to client dependencies)
  mongodb c++ driver (branch 26compat)
  Ravelin (commit 00b6184ae5dff492579dc864692a1f43248a0fec *latest is being serviced*)
 Database (to be installed on server system at this time)
  mongodb-2.6.0 (branch v2.6) [32-bit for local testing, 64-bit for deployment]

Installation:
 Database:
  1.
   Install mongo (branch v2.6) https://github.com/mongodb/mongo.git
   32-bit ok for testing.  64-bit for deployment as 32-bit has 2.4 GB limit
   refer to mongo/docs/building.md.
   Ex.
    ~> git clone https://github.com/mongodb/mongo.git
    ~> cd mongo
    ~/mongo> git checkout v2.6
    ~/mongo> sudo scons core --prefix=/opt/mongo install
  2. (these are general instructions based on http://docs.mongodb.org/v2.2/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-linux/.)
   Create a mongo user, e.g. mongodb, to limit access rights
   Create directory /data/db and give the mongo user ownership
   If --prefix was set to something outside the system path, e.g. /opt/mongo, 
    export that path including a bin subfolder, i.e. /opt/mongo/bin to the 
    system PATH variable in the mongo user bash script
  3. (Configuring MongoDB)
   Note: MongoDB has various security configurations but the key security note
    is that by default MongoDB opens an two unsecure ports if not properly 
    configured.  Take measures documented at
    http://docs.mongodb.org/v2.2/administration/security/ 
    to ensure MongoDB is not opening a vulnerability to your system.  For 
    simplest installations with MongoDB running on the same system as the 
    Reveal Server, run mongodb server at least with nounixsocket enabled, 
    nohttpinterface enabled and bind=127.0.0.1 (loopback address only).  Assume
    that mongo has opened a vulnerability unless these parameters are set.

 Server:
  1.
   Install mongo-cxx-driver (branch 26compat) https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver.git
    Ex.
    ~> git clone https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver.git
    ~> cd mongo-cxx-driver
    ~/mongo-cxx-driver> git checkout 26compat
    ~> sudo scons --full --use-system-boost --prefix=/usr/local --sharedclient --install-mongoclient
    - or -
    ~> sudo scons --32 --sharedclient --release --full --use-system-boost --cpppath=/usr/include install-mongoclient
   Note: I've used both methods to install, but you pretty much have to specify 
   everything in the first example at a minimum.
  2.
   Make and Install Reveal
    Currently, there is no cmake configuration to differentiate between client
    only, server only and full install.  To make and install, in the top level
    Reveal directory:
     ~> mkdir build
     ~> cd build
     ~> cmake ..
     ~> make
     ~> sudo make install
