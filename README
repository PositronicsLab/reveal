Database:
 Start the Database service
  In a terminal instance, log into the mongo user and run 
   ~> mongod
  Note: this terminal instance must remain open while running Reveal or when
  executing data operations.  Ctrl-C in this terminal safely closes the db; 
  otherwise, the db will require the repair parameter to fix.

 Create a Database
  In a terminal instance, log into the mongo user and run mongo
   In the subsequent data session, create a database at the prompt
    > use test
   Note: you may want to keep this terminal instance up for issuing commands
   directly on the database.  Useful commands are.
    > use <dbname>           # creates a database and sets it as active
    > db.dbDropDatabase()    # drops a db.  Pair with 'use' above to purge a db.
    > db.scenario.find( {} ) # lists all the scenarios in the db
    > db.trial.find( {} )    # lists all the trials in the db
    > db.solution.find( {} ) # lists all the user solutions in the db
   
Reveal Server:
 The Reveal Server connects to the mongo supported database.  The Reveal Server
 communicates with the database via the mongo-cxx-driver.  All references to
 mongo are encapsulated within the revealdb library.  The revealdb library is
 only necessary on the server as all db transactions are managed server side.
 Once Reveal is installed, the server is run at the command line by
  ~> revealserver
 Note: this terminal instance must remain open while running Reveal

Reveal Client:
 The Reveal Client connects to the Reveal Server.  Currently, this is all 
 hardcoded to localhost but the transport will easily work across networks.
 At the command line
  ~> revealclient
